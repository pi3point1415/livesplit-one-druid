This is a slightly modified version of the livesplit frontend that increments numbers in brackets in your split names when you split, allowing for keeping track of the number of attempts for each segment. It relies on a slightly modified livesplit-core available at [https://github.com/pi3point1415/livesplit-core](https://github.com/pi3point1415/livesplit-core).

# LiveSplit One Druid

A prototype Desktop version of LiveSplit One, using the Druid framework and the multiplatform
[livesplit-core][livesplit-core] library.

The Web Version is available at [one.livesplit.org](https://one.livesplit.org/).

## Installation Instructions

Download the latest release for your operating system and archictecture here:
https://github.com/AlexKnauth/livesplit-one-druid/releases/latest

When you run LiveSplit One Druid,
it needs to have permission to read memory of other processes.
- On Mac, that might require running it under `sudo`.
- On Linux, give it permission with one of:
  - setting the capabilities to include `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, which can be done with
    `sudo setcap CAP_SYS_PTRACE=+eip LiveSplitOne` or some variation of that
  - setting `/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope` to 0, which can be done with
    `echo "0"|sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope`
  - running it under `sudo`
- On Windows, it should just work. Windows allows memory reading by default.

## Build Instructions

In order to build LiveSplit One you need the [Rust
Compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/). You can then build and run the project
with:

```bash
cargo run
```

In order to build and run a release build, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Configuration

The config file and log file are located in the local data directory from [data_local_dir][data_local_dir]:
- Windows: `C:\Users\<name>\AppData\Local\LiveSplit\LiveSplit One\data\config.yml`
- Mac: `/Users/<name>/Library/Application Support/org.LiveSplit.LiveSplit-One/config.yml`
- Linux: `/home/<name>/.local/share/livesplitone/config.yml` or `/root/.local/share/livesplitone/config.yml` if running as `sudo`

If you want a log file, edit the `log` section of the config file to say

```yaml
log:
  enable: true
  level: INFO
  clear: true
```

 Once you run it with an autosplitter open, a `log.txt` file should appear in the same directory as the config.
